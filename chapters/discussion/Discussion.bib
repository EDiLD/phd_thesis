	abstract = {EFSA‘s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) was tasked to revise the Guidance
Document (GD) on Aquatic Ecotoxicology under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (SANCO/3268/2001 rev.4
(final), 17 October 2002). This Guidance of the PPR Panel is the first of three requested deliverables within this
mandate. It has its focus on tiered acute and chronic effect assessment schemes with detailed guidance on tier 1
and higher tier effect assessments for aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and on proposals
regarding how to link effects to exposure estimates. The exposure assessment methodology was not reviewed
and it is assumed that the current FOCUS surface water exposure assessment methodology will continue to be
used for exposure assessment at EU level. The current GD is intended to be used for authorisation of active
substances at EU level as well as for plant protection products at Member State level. The effect assessment
schemes in this GD allow for the derivation of regulatory acceptable concentrations (RACs) on the basis of two
options: (1) the ecological threshold option (ETO), accepting negligible population effects only, and (2) the
ecological recovery option (ERO), accepting some population-level effects if ecological recovery takes place
within an acceptable time period. In the tiered effect assessment schemes, in principle, all tiers (1, 2 and 3) are
able to address the ETO, while the model ecosystem approach (tier 3), under certain conditions, is able to also
address the ERO. The GD provides the scientific background for the risk assessment to aquatic organisms in
edge-of-field surface waters and is structured to give detailed guidance on all assessment steps. An executive
summary joining all parts of the guidance and decision schemes in a concise way is provided and is intended to
help applicants and regulatory authorities in day-to-day use.},

	abstract = {Mesocosm experiments that study the ecological impact of chemicals are often analysed using the multivariate method ‘Principal Response Curves’ (PRCs). Recently, the extension of generalised linear models (GLMs) to multivariate data was introduced as a tool to analyse community data in ecology. Moreover, data aggregation techniques that can be analysed with univariate statistics have been proposed. The aim of this study was to compare their performance. We compiled macroinvertebrate abundance datasets of mesocosm experiments designed for studying the effect of various organic chemicals, mainly pesticides, and re-analysed them. GLMs for multivariate data and selected aggregated endpoints were compared to PRCs regarding their performance and potential to identify affected taxa. In addition, we analysed the inter-replicate variability encountered in the studies. Mesocosm experiments characterised by a higher taxa richness of the community and/or lower taxonomic resolution showed a greater inter-replicate variability, whereas variability decreased the more zero counts were encountered in the samples. GLMs for multivariate data performed equally well as PRCs regarding the community response. However, compared to first axis PRCs, GLMs provided a better indication of individual taxa responding to treatments, as separate models are fitted to each taxon. Data aggregation methods performed considerably poorer compared to PRCs. Multivariate community data, which are generated during mesocosm experiments, should be analysed using multivariate methods to reveal treatment-related community-level responses. GLMs for multivariate data are an alternative to the widely used PRCs.},

	abstract = {*  ‘Will my study answer my research question?’ is the most fundamental question a researcher can ask when designing a study, yet when phrased in statistical terms – ‘What is the power of my study?’ or ‘How precise will my parameter estimate be?’ – few researchers in ecology and evolution (EE) try to answer it, despite the detrimental consequences of performing under- or over-powered research. We suggest that this reluctance is due in large part to the unsuitability of simple methods of power analysis (broadly defined as any attempt to quantify prospectively the ‘informativeness’ of a study) for the complex models commonly used in EE research. With the aim of encouraging the use of power analysis, we present simulation from generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) as a flexible and accessible approach to power analysis that can account for random effects, overdispersion and diverse response distributions.


* We illustrate the benefits of simulation-based power analysis in two research scenarios: estimating the precision of a survey to estimate tick burdens on grouse chicks and estimating the power of a trial to compare the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in malaria mosquito control. We provide a freely available R function, sim.glmm, for simulating from GLMMs.


* Analysis of simulated data revealed that the effects of accounting for realistic levels of random effects and overdispersion on power and precision estimates were substantial, with correspondingly severe implications for study design in the form of up to fivefold increases in sampling effort. We also show the utility of simulations for identifying scenarios where GLMM-fitting methods can perform poorly.


* These results illustrate the inadequacy of standard analytical power analysis methods and the flexibility of simulation-based power analysis for GLMMs. The wider use of these methods should contribute to improving the quality of study design in EE.},

These data were used to investigate the importance of test-species selection in constructing species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) and the ability of estimated hazardous concentrations (HCs) to protect freshwater aquatic ecosystems. A log-normal model was fitted to a minimum of six data points, and the resulting distribution was used to estimate lower (95\% confidence), median (50\% confidence), and upper (5\% confidence) 5\% HC (HC5) values. Species sensitivity distributions for specific taxonomic groups (vertebrates, arthropods, nonarthropod invertebrates), habitats (saltwater, freshwater, lentic, lotic), and geographical regions (Palaearctic, Nearctic, temperate, tropical) were compared. The taxonomic composition of the species assemblage used to construct the SSD does have a significant influence on the assessment of hazard, but the habitat and geographical distribution of the species do not. Moreover, SSDs constructed using species recommended in test guidelines did not differ significantly from those constructed using nonrecommended species. Hazardous concentrations estimated using laboratory-derived acute toxicity data for freshwater arthropods (i.e., the most sensitive taxonomic group) were compared to the response of freshwater ecosystems exposed to insecticides. The sensitivity distributions of freshwater arthropods were similar for both field and laboratory exposure, and the lower HC5 (95\% protection with 95\% confidence) estimate was protective of adverse ecological effects in freshwater ecosystems. The corresponding median HC5 (95\% protection level with 50\% confidence) was generally protective of single applications of insecticide but not of continuous or multiple applications. In the latter cases, a safety factor of at least five should be applied to the median HC5.},

	volume = {9},
	abstract = {This paper describes the usefulness of the group of multivariate techniques belonging to ordination for the analysis of ecotoxicological data sets. It is argued that although ecotoxicologists often gather multivariate data sets, they usually do not evaluate them with techniques that can handle multivariate data. Ordination techniques enable the researcher to extract an underlying structure out of a data set (eg. differences in composition of macro-invertebrate community between sites) and, if measured, relate this structure to explanatory variables (eg. concentrations of toxicants at the same sites). Five example data sets are presented to illustrate the underlying theory and the possibilities of ordination techniques. Two methods are presented, one based on weighted summation (eg. Principal Component Analysis, PCA) and one on weighted averaging (eg. Correspondence Analysis, CA). These techniques differ in the shape of the modelled response (linear versus unimodal) as the type of data they model (absolute versus relative). Results of these two methods are illustrated using a data set comprising levels of different PCB congeners measured in the blood of Adélie penguins in three periods. After this the constrained forms of PCA and CA are discussed, ie. constrained means that they are able to optimally display the differences in species composition (here levels of PCB congeners) due to explanatory variables (here period). Further examples illustrate the use of covariables, continuous and nominal explanatory variables, supplementary explanatory variables and forward selection of explanatory variables. Finally, two examples of Principal Response Curves (PRC) analyses are given. PRC is a technique that is especially developed to analyse time-series in which a control or reference is present. The PRC results are discussed for a designed experiment and a monitoring data set. The paper ends with a discussion focussing on the comparison between ordination techniques and other multivariate techniques used in the field of ecotoxicology.},

	abstract = {Despite a changing world in terms of data sharing, availability, and transparency, there are still major resource issues associated with collating datasets that will satisfy the requirements of comprehensive pesticide risk assessments, especially those undertaken at a regional or national scale. In 1996, a long-term project was initiated to begin collating and formatting pesticide data to eventually create a free-to-all repository of data that would provide a comprehensive transparent, harmonized, and managed extensive dataset for all types of pesticide risk assessments. Over the last 20 years, this database has been keeping pace with improving risk assessments, their associated data requirements, and the needs and expectations of database end users. In 2007, the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB) was launched as a free-to-access website. Currently, the PPDB holds data for almost 2300 pesticide active substances and over 700 metabolites. For each substance around 300 parameters are stored, covering human health, environmental quality, and biodiversity risk assessments. With the approach of the twentieth anniversary of the database, this article seeks to elucidate the current data model, data sources, its validation, and quality control processes and describes a number of existing risk assessment applications that depend upon it.},

	abstract = {Given the multitude of pesticides used in agriculture, adjacent streams are typically exposed to pesticide mixtures. Previous studies analysed the ecological risks of a few pesticide mixtures or were limited to an individual region or crop, whereas a large scale analysis of pesticide mixtures is missing. We analysed routine monitoring data from Germany, France, the Netherlands and the USA comprising a total of 4532 sites and 56,084 sampling occasions with the aim to identify the most frequently detected pesticides, their metabolites and mixtures. The most frequently detected compounds were dominated by herbicides and their metabolites. Mixtures mostly comprised of two up to five compounds, whereas mixtures in the USA and France had clearly less compounds than those of Germany and the Netherlands. The number of detected pesticides and thereby the size of mixtures is positively correlated to the number of measured pesticides (r = 0.57). In contrast, a low relationship was found to the ratio of agricultural areas within the catchment (r = 0.17), and no relationship was found to the size of the catchment (r = 0.06). Overall, our study provides priority mixtures for different countries that may be used for future ecotoxicological studies to improve risk assessment for stream ecosystems.},
