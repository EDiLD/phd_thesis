\section{Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA)}
Ecological Risk Assessment is based on two main components: Effects and Exposure Assessment, which are combined in ecological risk assessment.
Exposure Assessment aims to derive a predicted environmental concentration (PEC) using mainly modeling techniques.
Effect Assessment identifies hazards to the environmental ....

\section{Objectives and Outline of the thesis}
This thesis pursues three objectives: 
\begin{enumerate}[i]
	\item to scrutinize new methods in statistical ecotoxicology,
	\item explore available monitoring data and
	\item provide tools to deal with data in ERA
\end{enumerate}
Figure \ref{fig:intro:overview} provides an overview on the research performed and its relation to ERA as outlined in the previous sections.

\noindent
The thesis starts with a comparison of statistical methods to analyse ecotoxicological experiments (Chapter \ref{sec:usetheglm}). 
Specific questions addressed were:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Are newer statistical methods more powerful than currently used methods?
	\item How much statistical power do current experimental designs in ecotoxicology exhibit?
\end{itemize}

\noindent
ERA focuses with its predictions on small streams. Chapter \ref{sec:smallstreams} focuses on realised environmental concentrations.
Specific goals were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Compile all available monitoring data on pesticides in Germany, with a focus on small streams.
	\item Derive thresholds for agricultural use and catchment size.
	\item Assess the current pollution in german streams.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The compilation of monitoring data from different data sources, lead to a big inhomogeneous amount of data that first needs to be harmonized.
Chapters \ref{sec:webchem} (chemical data) and \ref{sec:taxize} (biological data) describe software solutions to simplify and accelerate the workflow of:

\begin{itemize}
	\item validating and harmonizing chemical and taxonomic names
	\item link them to other datasets
	\item search properties and identifiers
\end{itemize}
