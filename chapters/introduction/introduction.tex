\section{Threats of freshwater ecosystems from chemical pollution}

Freshwaters ecosystems, like streams, lakes and wetlands, make up only 0.01\% of the World's water and cover only 0.8\% of Earths surface \citep{dudgeon_freshwater_2006}, yet they host an important component of global biodiversity. 
Freshwaters are a habitat for more than 125,000 species, which represents 10\% of global biodiversity and \sfrac{1}{3} of all vertebrate species \citep{balian_freshwater_2007,  strayer_freshwater_2010} and provide essential services for human well-being \citep{aylward_freshwater_2005}. 
Small waterbodies are of particular importance, because of their high abundance \citep{downing_global_2012}, the high biodiversity they host \citep{davies_comparative_2008} and the ecosystem services they provide \citep{biggs_importance_2016}. 

Earth is currently experiencing a functional change driven by human activities which are so far-reaching, that a new geological epoche "Anthropocene" has been proposed \citep{waters_anthropocene_2016}. 
These changes are also associated with biotic changes: 65\% of rivers are currently at threat \citep{vorosmarty_global_2010} and freshwaters are experiencing the greatest losses of biodiversity \citep{wwf_living_2016}. 
A multitude of stressors contribute to this deterioration of freshwater biodiversity including habitat loss and degradation, overexploitation, invasive species and pollution \citep{dudgeon_freshwater_2006, vorosmarty_global_2010, wwf_living_2016}. 
Studies investigating water pollution have mainly focused on nutrient loading, acidification and pollution by organic loading \citep{schafer_contribution_2016}. 

Despite their potential negative effects for biota and humans, pesticides have been neglected in the past by ecological studies investigating threats to freshwaters \citep{schafer_contribution_2016} and it is unknown how much the contribute to biodiversity loss \citep{rockstrom_safe_2009.persson_confronting_2013}. 
However, recent studies indicated that pollution by pesticides may be a frequent threat to freshwaters that might have been neglected by ecological studies in the past.
\citet{malaj_organic_2014} showed that almost half of European water bodies are at risk from pesticides. 
In the United States, \citet{stone_pesticides_2014} showed that 61\% of assessed agricultural streams exceed aquatic-life benchmarks
On a global scale, \citet{stehle_pesticide_2015} found that 52.4\% of detected insecticide concentrations (n = 11,300) exceeded risk thresholds.

The high contact with adjacent land and low water volume of small streams make them particularly vulnerable to pesticide pollution \citep{biggs_importance_2016, lorenz_specifics_2016}. 

As reaction to the degradation of freshwaters several legal frameworks have been established to safeguard and improve the quality of freshwater ecosystems. 
In the European Union, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) \citep{european_union_directive_2009} regulates the protection and sustainable use of European freshwater.
Knowing of the toxicity of chemicals and their intentional release of pesticides into the environment, the use of pesticides is highly regulated in the European Union. 
% In order to estimate the risks associated with pesticide use, ecological risk assessment procedures have been established \cite (eu)

\section{Ecological Risk Assessment}

Ecological risk assessment (ERA) tries to estimate risks to animals, populations or ecosystems.
It investigates if a chemical can be used as intended without a causing detrimental impacts to the environment. 
ERA is used as a tool to support decision making under uncertainty \citep{newman_fundamentals_2015}. 
Ecological risk is defined as a combination of the severity and the probability of occurrence of a potential adverse effect \citep{suter_ecological_2007}. 
Therefore, ERA is based on two components: Effect- and exposure assessment.
A combination of both is needed to characterise ecological risks.

% Effect assessment
Effect assessment characterises the strength of effects using laboratory and semi-field experiments.
It establishes relationships between the concentration of a compound and the observed ecological effects.
In the European Union a tiered approach with increasing complexity and realism.
Lower tier assessment is based on highly standardised single species laboratory experiments, whereas higher tier assessment is refined by testing additional species, extended laboratory experiments or model ecosystem experiments. 
To address the various uncertainties in effect assessment (e.g. experimental variation, variation between species, variation in environmental conditions etc) the retrieved toxicity values are multiplied by an assessment factor between 0.01 (lower tier assessment) and 0.5 (higher tier assessment) depending on data quality, which yields to a regulatory acceptable concentration (RAC) \citep{efsa_guidance_2013}. 

% Exposure assessment
Exposure Assessment for freshwaters aims to characterise the probability of an adverse effect by deriving a predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in surface waters and sediments \citep{newman_fundamentals_2015}. 
It is mainly based on modeling the fate of chemicals in the environment using computer simulations. 
In the European Union, the FOCUS models are used \citep{focus_focus_2001, efsa_guidance_2013}.
To calculate PECs these models need many compound specific input parameters like the molecular weight, water solubility, partitioning coefficients and dissipation time. 
Additionally, information on the application regime and crop type is needed. 
FOCUS models the concentration within edge-of-field streams of 1~meter width and 30cm depth \citep{erlacher_regulation_2011}. 
Nevertheless, recent research showed that FOCUS models fail predict measured field concentrations of pesticides \citep{knabel_regulatory_2012, knabel_fungicide_2014}. 

% Risk characterisation
The final step in ERA is risk characterisation.
It puts together the information gained from effect and exposure assessment. 
Risk can be expressed in several ways, a quantitative way being the risk quotient approach: A PEC / RAC ratio greater than one indicating potential risks \citep{efsa_guidance_2013, suter_ecological_2007, amiard-triquet_aquatic_2015}. 
Substances with a ratio lower than one could be approved for usage and potential release to the environment.

\section{Environmental Monitoring}

Concerns about the environmental state have lead to extensive monitoring activities. 
Widespread anthropogenic activities induced environmental changes have resulted in concerns about the state of the environment and have lead to the development of environmental monitoring programs worldwide \citep{nichols_monitoring_2006}. 
In Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) \citep{european_union_directive_2000} establishes monitoring requirements for all European river basins. 
These monitoring efforts are used to estimate the environmental state and trends. 

Environmental monitoring can be complementary to ecological risk assessment \citep{suter_ecological_2007}.
Moreover, data from long-term monitoring programs can be used to study hypotheses about spatial and temporal dynamics and interactions, that are not evident from short term and short scale studies \citep{gitzen_design_2012}.
Therefore, monitoring data could be used to inform and review ERA after approval \citep{knauer_pesticides_2016}. 
However, there is a mismatch between streams assessed: The WFD aims at monitoring medium size to large streams greater than 10~$km^2$ catchment size, whereas ERA assesses risks for streams corresponding to a catchment size of approximately 7~$km^2$ (corresponding to 1~meter width, see Figure~\ref{fig:size_width} \textcolor{red}{ref to small streams supplement}).

\section{Statistical Ecotoxicology}
% Link to previous section
Ecological effect assessment generates data on ecological effects using experiments. 
The produced datasets range from small univariate datasets (lower tier assessment) to medium sized multivariate datasets (higher tier assessment).
% Statistical Ecotoxicology
These datasets are analysed using statistical techniques in order to extract usable information for assessment and therefore, statistics are crucial for effect assessment \citep{newman_quantitative_2012}.
Statistical ecotoxicology combines statistics with the specific needs and constraints of ecotoxicology. 
It aims to provide solutions to statistical challenges in ecotoxicology \citep{fox_comment_2016}, guidance on experimental designs \citep{johnson_power_2015} and tools to integrate big data \citep {van_den_brink_new_2016} to improve accuracy of ERA. 

% Dose-response, NOEC
The relationships between the concentration of a compound and the observed effects are usually analysed using dose-response models, which can be used to derive an effective concentration for x\% effect ($EC_{x}$) \citep{ritz_toward_2010}. 
Nevertheless, such relationships cannot always be established from experimental data.
For example, model ecosystem experiments are conducted to characterise effects on whole biological communities.
However, because of multivariate responses and potential indirect effects, there is no clear dose-response relationship and no models for this kind of data available. 
There are also other examples were fitting dose-response models is problematic \citep{green_issues_2016}. 
In such cases, there is usually a no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) computed. 

The NOEC is the highest tested concentration that does not lead to significant deviation from the control response and therefore relies on null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). 
However, the use of NOEC as toxicity measure in ecological effect assessment has been heavily criticised in the past \citep{laskowski_good_1995, chapman_warning:_1996, warne_noec_2008, fox_what_2012, jager_bad_2012, fox_dont_2016}. 
One such critic is the low statistical power for NHST in common ecotoxicological experiments \citep{van_der_hoeven_power_1998}.
\emph{A priori} power calculations can provide useful guidance for choosing experimental designs \citep{johnson_power_2015}, but are rarely used by ecotoxicologists \citep{newman_what_2008}. 

Instead of conducting experiments, toxicity could be also predicted from molecular structures using quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), which are usually calculated using machine-learning techniques \citep{murrell_chemically_2015, cortes-ciriano_bioalerts:_2016}. 
Nevertheless, in order to improve these models to give sufficient prediction accuracy more data from experiments is needed \citep{kuhne_read-across_2013}. 

% Big data
A large amount of data is available that could be used for effect and exposure assessment. 
For example, the US EPA ECOTOX database \citep{u.s._epa_ecotoxicology_2016}, the Pesticides Properties Database \citep{lewis_international_2016} and ETOX \citep{umweltbundesamt_etox:_2016} provide toxicity data that could be used for effect assessment.
Databases like Physprop \citep{howard_physical_2016} and PubChem \citep{kim_pubchem_2016} provide chemical properties that are needed as input for exposure models.
Monitoring data provides information on realised concentrations, could be used for validation of models and retrospective risk assessment.
This "big data" can provide new information and opportunities for ERA \citep{dafforn_big_2015}. 
However, it needs to be linked and easily accessible in order to be used effectively in ERA.

\section{Objectives and Outline of the thesis}

The overall goal of this thesis was to contribute to the emerging field of statistical ecotoxicology, ecological risk assessment and environmental monitoring.
The main objectives were (i) to scrutinise new methods in statistical ecotoxicology,
(ii) explore available monitoring data and
(iii) provide tools to deal with big data.
Figure \ref{fig:intro:overview} provides a conceptual overview on ERA and environmental monitoring as outlined in the previous sections, as well as the parts of this thesis and its relations. 

\noindent The thesis starts with a comparison of statistical methods to analyse ecotoxicological experiments in effect assessment (Chapter \ref{sec:usetheglm}). 
Specific questions addressed were:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Are newer statistical methods more powerful than currently used methods for NHST?
	\item How much statistical power do current experimental designs in ecotoxicology exhibit?
\end{itemize}


\noindent Exposure assessment aims at predicting chemical concentrations in small streams. 
Chapter \ref{sec:smallstreams} focuses on measured large-scale environmental concentrations and the drivers thereof. 
Specific goals were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Compile all available monitoring data on pesticides in small streams in Germany
	\item Explore the relationship between agricultural land use and streams size and measured pesticide concentrations.
	\item Study annual dynamics of pesticide exposure, as well as the influence of precipitation on measured pesticide concentrations.
	\item Assess the current pollution in German streams and identify responsible pesticides.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The compilation of monitoring data from different data sources, lead to a big inhomogeneous amount of data that first needs to be harmonised.
Chapter \ref{sec:webchem} (chemical data) and Chapter \ref{sec:taxize} (biological data) describe software solutions to simplify and accelerate the workflow of:

\begin{itemize}
	\item validating and harmonising chemical and taxonomic data
	\item linking datasets
	\item retrieving properties and identifiers
\end{itemize}
