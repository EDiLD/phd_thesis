	volume = {46},
	abstract = {The FOrum for the Co-ordination of pesticide fate models and their USe (FOCUS) exposure models are used to predict the frequency and magnitude of pesticide surface water concentrations within the European regulatory risk assessment. The predictions are based on realistic worst-case assumptions that result in predicted environmental concentrations (PEC). Here, we compared for the first time a larger data set of 122 measured field concentrations (MFC) of agricultural insecticides extracted from 22 field studies to respective PECs by using FOCUS steps 1–4. While FOCUS step 1 and 2 PECs generally overpredicted the MFCs, 23\% of step 3 and 31\% of step 4 standard PECs were exceeded by surface water MFCs, which questions the protectiveness of the FOCUS exposure assessment. Using realistic input parameters, step 3 simulations underpredicted MFCs in surface water and sediment by 43\% and 78\%, respectively, which indicate that a higher degree of realism even reduces the protectiveness of model results. The ratios between PEC and MFC in surface water were significantly lower for pyrethroids than for organophosphorus or organochlorine insecticides, which suggests that the FOCUS predictions are less protective for hydrophobic insecticides. In conclusion, the FOCUS modeling approach is not protective for insecticide concentrations in the field.},

	volume = {32},
	abstract = {According to the European REACH Directive, the acute daphnid toxicity needs to be assessed for industrial chemicals with market volumes ≥1 t/a. Employing a data set of 1365 organic compounds with experimental 48-h LC50 data for Daphnia magna, a read-across approach has been developed that makes use of the atom-centered fragment (ACF) method as quantitative measure for structural similarity. Both quantitative log LC50 predictions and a discrimination between narcosis-level and excess toxicity can be obtained, augmented by similarity-triggered information that characterizes a compound as inside or outside the quantitative or qualitative model domain. Reading across proceeds as interpolation of the toxicity enhancement (Te) over predicted narcosis-level toxicity, taking experimental log Te values from similarity-selected reference compounds as input. The resultant decision tree model yields r2=0.85 and rms=0.66 for the subset of 757 compounds (56 \%) identified as inside the quantitative model domain, and can handle further 318 compounds (23 \%) with the categorical submodel, with 290 compounds (21 \%) being outside its domain. The new in silico approach appears useful as ITS (Integrated Testing Strategy) tool for the daphnid toxicity assessment. The discussion includes a comparison of Kow- and LSER-predicted narcosis-level toxicity in the read-across context.},

	abstract = {Highly complex process-driven mechanistic fate and transport models and multimedia mass balance models can be used for the exposure prediction of pesticides in different environmental compartments. Generally, both types of models differ in spatial and temporal resolution. Process-driven mechanistic fate models are very complex, and calculations are time-intensive. This type of model is currently used within the European regulatory pesticide registration (FOCUS). Multimedia mass-balance models require fewer input parameters to calculate concentration ranges and the partitioning between different environmental media. In this study, we used the fugacity-based small-region model (SRM) to calculate predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) for 466 cases of insecticide field concentrations measured in European surface waters. We were able to show that the PECs of the multimedia model are more protective in comparison to FOCUS. In addition, our results show that the multimedia model results have a higher predictive power to simulate varying field concentrations at a higher level of field relevance. The adaptation of the model scenario to actual field conditions suggests that the performance of the SRM increases when worst-case conditions are replaced by real field data. Therefore, this study shows that a less complex modeling approach than that used in the regulatory risk assessment exhibits a higher level of protectiveness and predictiveness and that there is a need to develop and evaluate new ecologically relevant scenarios in the context of pesticide exposure modeling.},
