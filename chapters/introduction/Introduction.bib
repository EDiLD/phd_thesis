The first chapters consider fundamental concepts and definitions essential to understanding the fate and effects of toxicants at various levels of ecological organization as covered in the remaining chapters. Scientific ecotoxicology and associated topics are defined. The historical perspective, rationale, and characteristics are outlined for the strong inferential and quantitative approach advocated in this book. The general measurement process is discussed, and methodologies for defining and controlling variance, which could otherwise exclude valid conclusions regarding ecotoxicological endeavors, are considered.Ecotoxicological concepts at increasing levels of ecological organization are discussed in the second part of the book. Quantitative methods used to measure toxicant effects are outlined in this section. The final chapter summarizes the book with a brief discussion of ecotoxicological assessment. Numerous figures and tables accompany text, with many statistical tables found in the appendix for quick reference. Although the book primarily focuses on aquatic systems, with appropriate modification the concepts and methods can be applied to terrestrial systems"--},

Document (GD) on Aquatic Ecotoxicology under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (SANCO/3268/2001 rev.4
(final), 17 October 2002). This Guidance of the PPR Panel is the first of three requested deliverables within this
mandate. It has its focus on tiered acute and chronic effect assessment schemes with detailed guidance on tier 1
and higher tier effect assessments for aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and on proposals
regarding how to link effects to exposure estimates. The exposure assessment methodology was not reviewed
and it is assumed that the current FOCUS surface water exposure assessment methodology will continue to be
used for exposure assessment at EU level. The current GD is intended to be used for authorisation of active
substances at EU level as well as for plant protection products at Member State level. The effect assessment
schemes in this GD allow for the derivation of regulatory acceptable concentrations (RACs) on the basis of two
options: (1) the ecological threshold option (ETO), accepting negligible population effects only, and (2) the
ecological recovery option (ERO), accepting some population-level effects if ecological recovery takes place
within an acceptable time period. In the tiered effect assessment schemes, in principle, all tiers (1, 2 and 3) are
able to address the ETO, while the model ecosystem approach (tier 3), under certain conditions, is able to also
address the ERO. The GD provides the scientific background for the risk assessment to aquatic organisms in
edge-of-field surface waters and is structured to give detailed guidance on all assessment steps. An executive
summary joining all parts of the guidance and decision schemes in a concise way is provided and is intended to
help applicants and regulatory authorities in day-to-day use.},

	abstract = {*  ‘Will my study answer my research question?’ is the most fundamental question a researcher can ask when designing a study, yet when phrased in statistical terms – ‘What is the power of my study?’ or ‘How precise will my parameter estimate be?’ – few researchers in ecology and evolution (EE) try to answer it, despite the detrimental consequences of performing under- or over-powered research. We suggest that this reluctance is due in large part to the unsuitability of simple methods of power analysis (broadly defined as any attempt to quantify prospectively the ‘informativeness’ of a study) for the complex models commonly used in EE research. With the aim of encouraging the use of power analysis, we present simulation from generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) as a flexible and accessible approach to power analysis that can account for random effects, overdispersion and diverse response distributions.


* We illustrate the benefits of simulation-based power analysis in two research scenarios: estimating the precision of a survey to estimate tick burdens on grouse chicks and estimating the power of a trial to compare the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in malaria mosquito control. We provide a freely available R function, sim.glmm, for simulating from GLMMs.


* Analysis of simulated data revealed that the effects of accounting for realistic levels of random effects and overdispersion on power and precision estimates were substantial, with correspondingly severe implications for study design in the form of up to fivefold increases in sampling effort. We also show the utility of simulations for identifying scenarios where GLMM-fitting methods can perform poorly.


* These results illustrate the inadequacy of standard analytical power analysis methods and the flexibility of simulation-based power analysis for GLMMs. The wider use of these methods should contribute to improving the quality of study design in EE.},

The predictions are based on realistic worst-case assumptions that result in predicted environmental concentrations (PEC). Here, we compared for the first time a larger data set of 122 measured field concentrations (MFC) of agricultural insecticides extracted from 22 field studies to respective PECs by using FOCUS steps 1–4. While FOCUS step 1 and 2 PECs generally overpredicted the MFCs, 23\% of step 3 and 31\% of step 4 standard PECs were exceeded by surface water MFCs, which questions the protectiveness of the FOCUS exposure assessment. Using realistic input parameters, step 3 simulations underpredicted MFCs in surface water and sediment by 43\% and 78\%, respectively, which indicate that a higher degree of realism even reduces the protectiveness of model results. The ratios between PEC and MFC in surface water were significantly lower for pyrethroids than for organophosphorus or organochlorine insecticides, which suggests that the FOCUS predictions are less protective for hydrophobic insecticides. In conclusion, the FOCUS modeling approach is not protective for insecticide concentrations in the field.},

	abstract = {According to the European REACH Directive, the acute daphnid toxicity needs to be assessed for industrial chemicals with market volumes ≥1 t/a. Employing a data set of 1365 organic compounds with experimental 48-h LC50 data for Daphnia magna, a read-across approach has been developed that makes use of the atom-centered fragment (ACF) method as quantitative measure for structural similarity. Both quantitative log LC50 predictions and a discrimination between narcosis-level and excess toxicity can be obtained, augmented by similarity-triggered information that characterizes a compound as inside or outside the quantitative or qualitative model domain. Reading across proceeds as interpolation of the toxicity enhancement (Te) over predicted narcosis-level toxicity, taking experimental log Te values from similarity-selected reference compounds as input. The resultant decision tree model yields r2=0.85 and rms=0.66 for the subset of 757 compounds (56 \%) identified as inside the quantitative model domain, and can handle further 318 compounds (23 \%) with the categorical submodel, with 290 compounds (21 \%) being outside its domain. The new in silico approach appears useful as ITS (Integrated Testing Strategy) tool for the daphnid toxicity assessment. The discussion includes a comparison of Kow- and LSER-predicted narcosis-level toxicity in the read-across context.},

In 1996, a long-term project was initiated to begin collating and formatting pesticide data to eventually create a free-to-all repository of data that would provide a comprehensive transparent, harmonized, and managed extensive dataset for all types of pesticide risk assessments. Over the last 20 years, this database has been keeping pace with improving risk assessments, their associated data requirements, and the needs and expectations of database end users. In 2007, the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB) was launched as a free-to-access website. Currently, the PPDB holds data for almost 2300 pesticide active substances and over 700 metabolites. For each substance around 300 parameters are stored, covering human health, environmental quality, and biodiversity risk assessments. With the approach of the twentieth anniversary of the database, this article seeks to elucidate the current data model, data sources, its validation, and quality control processes and describes a number of existing risk assessment applications that depend upon it.},

	abstract = {Small water bodies (SWB) are freshwater ecosystems of high ecological relevance. However, they receive considerably higher inputs of pesticides compared to larger water bodies owing to their close connection to adjacent agricultural fields in combination with their low water volume or discharge. Monitoring of the pesticide contamination of lentic and lotic SWB is a challenging task as various spatial and temporal factors affect pesticide’s maximum peak concentrations in the water bodies. We present an overview of the major challenges that can complicate the detection of exceedances of regulatory acceptable concentrations. Pesticide data from streams encompassed by the Danish pesticide monitoring program show that the highest pesticide concentrations are found in SWB. A ditch monitoring in a German orchard reveals that event-driven sampling following spray application outperforms the widely used automatic water sampling at fixed intervals, and we therefore suggest that the latter should replace the former in SWB. Furthermore, we suggest that gathering of quantitative data on pesticide pollution of lentic SWB should be given priority in future research.},

	abstract = {Highly complex process-driven mechanistic fate and transport models and multimedia mass balance models can be used for the exposure prediction of pesticides in different environmental compartments. Generally, both types of models differ in spatial and temporal resolution. Process-driven mechanistic fate models are very complex, and calculations are time-intensive. This type of model is currently used within the European regulatory pesticide registration (FOCUS). Multimedia mass-balance models require fewer input parameters to calculate concentration ranges and the partitioning between different environmental media. In this study, we used the fugacity-based small-region model (SRM) to calculate predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) for 466 cases of insecticide field concentrations measured in European surface waters. We were able to show that the PECs of the multimedia model are more protective in comparison to FOCUS. In addition, our results show that the multimedia model results have a higher predictive power to simulate varying field concentrations at a higher level of field relevance. The adaptation of the model scenario to actual field conditions suggests that the performance of the SRM increases when worst-case conditions are replaced by real field data. Therefore, this study shows that a less complex modeling approach than that used in the regulatory risk assessment exhibits a higher level of protectiveness and predictiveness and that there is a need to develop and evaluate new ecologically relevant scenarios in the context of pesticide exposure modeling.},
