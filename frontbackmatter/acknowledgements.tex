\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I thank all the persons that supported me during my studies and this dissertation.

My special thanks goes to my supervisor Prof. Dr. Ralf B. Sch√§fer for his support throughout the last six years. 
I am thankful for his openness to my ideas and the opportunities given to follow them, 
for organizing funding throughout this dissertation, 
for pushing me to sound scientific writing and critical reading, 
for challenging discussions, not only on statistical eco(-toxico)logy, but also outside of the subject area.

Many thanks to Prof. Dr. Ralf Schulz for examining this thesis and his influence on me during my undergrad studies.

Without the continuous support of my parents, Anca and Helmut, this thesis would not have been possible - Thank you!

I am grateful to my colleagues, students and other people for asking me tough statistical questions. 
These questions from a broad range of fields and finding solutions to them widened my expertise in the field.

Special thanks goes to Gunnar Oehmichen and Phillip Uhl for the discussions during coffee breaks.

I thank all collaborators of projects involved in this these, but also past projects. All of you provided help, critical comments and enlightning discussion on my work.

I am an advocate of "open-science" and tried to make this thesis as open and reproducible as possible. I would to thank people developing, maintaining and bug fixing the open software I used throughout this thesis. I thank GitHub for providing me a free account during the time writing this thesis - a robust version control system was crucial for big parts of this thesis. 

Lastly, I cannot thank enough my girlfriend, Anja Loescher, for getting through this stressful time with me.
Despite a stressful phase with her profession she always supported and encouraged me.
