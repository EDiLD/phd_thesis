Few may hear Galileo’s song (calling)\\
A tribulation\\
Adversities\\
Fuel for a living, feeds us all\\[1em]

Spirit is fire\\
Uncompromising\\
Hidden hand, protect us from\\
The dead and dying\\[1em]

Echo his madness\\
His heresy feeds us all\\[1em]

Spirit is fire\\

Hidden hand, protect us from\\

Few may\\[1em]

Spirit is fire\\
Feed on the senseless ending\\[1em]

- Song by \textit{Maynard James Keenan}


% However, I hear it in this way: This track speaks of the call of those searching for understanding. Understanding the greater place we live in, the secrets of the cosmos. Those desperately trying to hear the most quiet whispers detailing where we small little things fit into the vastness of existence. It's torture, we know so little, we can know only so very little, but anything gained is clung to til the grave. Some small section of the truth. It's precious, like water to a dying man in the desert. if this thirst for understanding is life, protect us from the dead and dying. This will drive you mad, but the madness is the only thing which is real. Our dramas? Our grandest games? Completely irrelevant. Echo Galileo's madness. The madness which drove him to die rather than let his treasured truth die with him. His heresy is the heresy of truth above silence, truth above falsehood. What was his heresy? That Earth was not the center of the cosmos. He exposed our insignificance, showed that there were bodies which orbited something aside from the earth. This song is very important to me. We have to keep going, keep learning, keep growing. Unpleasant as these truths may be, without them we can only live in darkness, covered in shit and death surrounded by shit and death.﻿

% Galileo's heresy is what pushed us forward, it feeds us, it is necessary.
