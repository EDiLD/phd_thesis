\textbf{Galileo}
\vspace*{3em}

Few may hear Galileoâ€™s song calling\\
A tribulation\\
Adversities\\
Fuel for a living, feeds us all\\[1em]

Spirit is fire\\
Uncompromising\\
Hidden hand, protect us from\\
The dead and dying\\[1em]

Echo his madness\\
His heresy feeds us all\\[1em]

Spirit is fire\\
Uncompromising\\
Hidden hand, protect us from\\
The dead and dying\\[1em]

Few may\\[1em]

Spirit is fire\\
Feed on the senseless ending\\[1em]

Spirit is fire\\
Feed on the senseless ending\\[3em]
