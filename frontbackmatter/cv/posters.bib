	title = {taxize: taxonomic search and retrieval in {R}},
	abstract = {Ecologists use data from many sources (e.g. own sampling, governmental monitoring data, data from web-datebases, ...).
All these data have a common ground: the taxonomic names of species they contain.
For a data analysis a crucial data-cleaning step is to match species identities across different datasets \cite{boyle\_taxonomic\_2013}. Taxonomic data is becoming increasingly available on the web, but scientists need an easy and reproducible way to access it.
 
We present \emph{taxize} \cite{chamberlain\_taxize:\_2013} - an open-source software package for the R language (freely available from \url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taxize/index.html}).
Taxize is part of the rOpenSci Initiative (\url{http://ropensci.org/}) and currently under development. 
It provides simple, programmatic access to taxonomic data for 14 data sources around the web. It simplifies data-cleaning steps, like fixing taxonomic names, aggregating data to a specific taxonomic level and matching tables by species names with different taxonomic resolutions.

We present this taxonomic tool belt in R and outline a suite of use cases for which taxize is ideally suited.
The taxize package facilitates open and reproducible science by allowing taxonomic data collection to be done in the open-source R platform. 
We hope taxize will be taken up by the community and developed collaboratively.},
